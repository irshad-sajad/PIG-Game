# PIG-Game
The project task is a PIG (a dice) GAME using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

👉 Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a dice until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold":

👉 If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.

👉 If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.

👉 If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
